# UML (Unified Modelling Language)

UML allows to visually document our programs.

We will focus on class diagrams.

Class diagrams show the relationship between classes, i.e.,
class hierarchies (superclasses and subclasses, interfaces, etc.).

For each class, all class variables are shown, along with all
methods in that class.
