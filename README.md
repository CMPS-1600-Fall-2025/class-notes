# CMPS 1600 Notes and Examples

This repository holds our lecture notes and programming examples and
will be continuously updated throughout the semester.

You can browse this code in this repository online. You can download or
[clone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/javascript/how-to/with-visual-studio-code/clone-github-repository?tabs=activity-bar) 
it to your machine to experiment with yourself.

Lecture notes will be written in Markdown and in-class programming examples
will be included as well.


## Interacting with the Notes Locally

In lecture, we will regularly code programming examples. I highly
recommend that you experiment and play with these examples yourself.

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your
IDE of choice.


## Updating the Notes

After every lecture, I will push the latest changes to our notes to
github. Once I do this, you can pull them down to your computer.

From the "Source Control" tab, click on the ellipsis at the top of the
source control pane. Click "Pull" and the latest changes will be 
downloaded to your machine.

## About Git

Git is what's known as a version control system and is used throughout
the software development industry. Git's purpose is to allow for remote
collaboration on large codebases (and small!). It was originally written
for the maintenance of the linux kernel. 

In recent years it has been a huge enabler of open source development.

Podcast](https://changelog.com/podcast) and you'll hear git and
[GitHub](https://github.com) come up again and again.
